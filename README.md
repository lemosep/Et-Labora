# Et-Labora
A chat to help users understand lessons from St. Josemaria Escriva's works. I'll be using Rust, OpenAI API, and qdrant vector database. Non-profit code, only looking forward to enlightening minds.

## Usage
This codebase has two versions, one written in Python by [@PedroVOliv](https://github.com/PedroVIOliv) and Rust by [@lemosep](https://github.com/lemosep).

The main idea is to scrape data from [escriva.org](https://escriva.org), getting all the points from St. Josemaria's three main books: The way, Furrow and the Forge.

Using OpenAI API, we're looking forward to build a virtual spiritual assistant, to answer questions and give advice.
